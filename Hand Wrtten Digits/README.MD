## Simple Neural Nerworks for Hand Written Digits Recognition

This is a simple neural network with 3 layers ( 1 input,1 hidden and 1 output layer).

This neural network is used to recongnize hand written digits.

This is just a side project which help me enchance my knowledge about Backpropagation Neural Networks.
